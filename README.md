# SaaS Company Landing Page

This is a part of Brad Traversy's Youtube HTML/CSS tutorial.

This project is from the [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/?ref=traversy) challenge website and does not use any frameworks or libraries. It is built with pure HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the hamburger menu and the FAQ accordion.
